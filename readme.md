This game uses Haxe and HaxeFlixel.

To be a playtester, just install Haxe and HaxeFlixel at [Haxe's official website](https://haxe.org/download/) and [HaxeFlixel's official website](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/), but only install if you don't have them installed.

# How to playtest

How can you playtest the game, you ask?
Well, it's easy.
Once you got the source code downloaded and both [Haxe](https://haxe.org) and [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com) installed, run this command at the main folder that contains 3 folders, and 2 files (Project.xml, hxformat.json, assets, source, .vscode):

For Linux, run this command:
```bash
lime test linux
```

For Windows, run this command:
```bash
lime test windows
```

For HTML, run this command:
```bash
lime test html5
```
To enable the debug mode, add -debug to the command, and the command should be like this:
```bash
lime test html5 -debug
```
Make sure to have [Visual Studio](https://ualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&cid=2030&passive=false) installed with C++ addons installed for it to work if you get errors but not code errors.
