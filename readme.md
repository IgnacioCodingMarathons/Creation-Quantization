# How to playtest

How can you playtest the game, you ask?
Well, it's easy.
Once you got the source code downloaded and both (Haxe)[https://haxe.org] and (HaxeFlixel)[https://haxeflixel.com] installed, run this command at the main folder that contains 3 folders, and 2 files (Project.xml, hxformat.json, assets, source, .vscode):

For Linux, run this command:
```
lime test linux
```

For Windows, run this command:
```
lime test windows
```

For HTML, run this command:
```
lime test html5
```
To enable the debug mode, add -debug to the command, and the command should be like this:
```
lime test html5 -debug
```
